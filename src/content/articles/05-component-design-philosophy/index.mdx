<Callout type="tldr" title="TL;DR:">
Component-driven design is an approach to building user interfaces using modular, reusable components. This method simplifies complex UIs by breaking them into smaller,
manageable pieces, making development and maintenance more efficient. It allows for creating interactive and visually appealing interfaces while ensuring scalability and ease of updates.

- keep it simple, stupid, and pure
- keep your components small and focused
- one component, one responsibility
- avoid mixing concerns in a single component
- design for change, not for current needs
- refactor when necessary to maintain single responsibility
- test components in isolation to ensure they fulfill their single responsibility
- document the purpose and responsibility of each component clearly
- benefits of a well-defined components
- principles of component design philosophy
- examples of component well designed in practice
- challenges and considerations in implementing a well-put component


In software development, the real challenge goes beyond writing code, it’s designing systems that can endure time and ever growing complexity.
The philosophy that survives are the lasting design principles at the core of sustainable software, valuing them far above the short-lived appeal of new shiny frameworks or tech.
The goal is to create code that can adapt and evolve, rather than slowly collapsing under the weight of it's own technical debt.
