## Hello. Zuko here

<Callout type="popcorn" title="Zuko">
  It’s time for you to look inward and begin asking yourself the big questions.
  </Callout>

Zuko is a blazing-fast, terminal-first CLI tool to supercharge your Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice.

## 🧠 Philosophy
Zuko embodies discipline, resilience, and growth. It's designed to help you build real momentum in your coding journey — by eliminating friction, promoting consistency, and making the terminal your training ground.

<Callout type="popcorn" title="That's you 🫵">
  That’s who you are, Zuko. Someone who keeps fighting even when it’s hard.
</Callout>

## 🎯 Our Goal
Make the developer terminal the first and only stop for solving, exploring, and practicing questions — even offline — and use version control to track your progress over time.

Inspired by the discipline and drive of Zuko from Avatar: The Last Airbender, this tool helps you stay consistent, focused, and efficient — bringing the full problem-solving experience right into your terminal.
